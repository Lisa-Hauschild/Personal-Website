     <div class="info"><p>Cephalopods are the most intelligent, most mobile, and the largest of all molluscs. Squid, octopuses, cuttlefish, the chambered nautilus, and their relatives display remarkable diversity in size and lifestyle with adaptations for predation, locomotion, disguise, and communication. These "brainy" invertebrates have evolved suckered tentacles, camera-like eyes, color-changing skin, and complex learning behavior. Their lengthy evolutionary history spans an impressive 500 million years and the abundant fossils they've left behind (mostly shelled nautiloids and ammonoids) record repeated speciation and extinction events. From myths about their enigmatic fossilized remains to fantastic accounts of tentacled sea monsters, cephalopods also figure prominently in the literature and folklore of human societies around the world. Today, biologists and paleontologists continue to captivate the human mind and imagination with details of these molluscs' behavior, natural history, and evolution.</p></div>


      <h2>Arms and tentacles</h2>

      <div class="info"><p> Arms and tentacles are another distinguishing cephalopod characteristic. All cephalopods have arms, but not all cephalopods have tentacles. Octopuses, cuttlefish, and squid have eight non-retractable arms, but only cuttlefish and squid (Sepioidea and Teuthoidea) have tentacles (two each). Arms usually have cirri (fleshy papillae/palps), often suckers, and sometimes hooks (modified suckers) along their undersides. These can be attached to the arm directly or by a flexible stalk and are used to adhere to substrates and catch prey. Tentacles are longer than arms, are retractable, and usually have a blade-shaped or flattened tip, called a club, which is covered in suckers. Squid and cuttlefish have one pair of tentacles and they use these to strike quickly at prey.</p></div>
